This data set is showcasing TCR measurement on two devices under test:
* Tinsley 5685A2 resistance standard, measured by Measurements International 6010B DCC bridge
* ESI SR1010-100 R2 element, measured by Keysight 3458A DMM
Both DUTs are located in air-bath and monitored with dedicated PT100 temperature sensor

Useful data is stored in columns:
* Timestamp/datestamp stored in column 1
* Ratio against 100.003368 Î© standard stored in column 5
* ESI SR1010-100 absolute value stored in column 11
* Ambient temperature sensor data stored in column 26
* Ambient humidity sensor data stored in column 27
* Ambient pressure sensor data stored in column 28
* PT100 DUT temperature sensor stored in column 30
* NTC for air-bath rear sensor stored in column 29
* Setpoint for air-bath stored in column 32
